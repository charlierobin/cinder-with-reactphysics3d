# Using Cinder with the ReactPhysics3D physics engine library in Xcode
 
 A simple Xcode project integrating the open source Cinder (OpenGL) library with the ReactPhysics3D library.

All this is really just intended to be the jumping off point for your own work.

You will need to update the Cinder path (CINDER_PATH in User-Defined in Build Settings of the project) in Xcode to your own installation. (Download Cinder from the Cinder web site.)

(The Xcode project was originally generated using TinderBox.)

All the ReactPhysics3D header files are included, together with a build of the library for your convenience.

If you want to substitute those with your own build, itâ€™s simple enough. (Download the source files, makes files etc from the ReactPhysics3D site.)


Cinder version: 0.9.2

ReactPhysics3D version: 0.8.0

The Cinder site: https://libcinder.org/ (Cinder is a free and open source library for professional-quality creative coding in C++.)

The ReactPhysics3D site: https://www.reactphysics3d.com/ (ReactPhysics3D is a C++ physics engine library that can be used in 3D simulations and games. The library is developed by Daniel Chappuis and is released under the open-source ZLib license.)
